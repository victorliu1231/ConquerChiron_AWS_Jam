-- add in a hand for the character model later at some point to help with cursor control, otherwise for now using cursor is good

- art
-- want a better inventory UI
-- 2d sprites:
--- towel, window cleaner, etc
- okay for whatever reason, the cursor disappears when clicking in the game, and this is causing onMouseOver to no longer run


- can put grace also on model tuning

- todo list
--- make spaceship environment art based off of current assets in spaceship asset pack (I think this is bugging me a lot bc rest of game depends on this)
--- make other minigames
--- timer DG Scale is not looping
--- spaceship asteroid task is too hard
--- get human model in game
--- do prelim research if it's easy to train meta llama model for customized output (lowkey could task Grace with this??? But I might be better since I actually took an ML class)
--- make a "gamer mode" where the asteroid task starts out with 50 asteroids, and a "non-gamer mode" for judges,
---- where the task starts out with 30 asteroids

-- Meta llama model
-- XEntity Inventory system (looks REALLY useful)
-- add in a hand for the character model later at some point to help with cursor control, otherwise for now using cursor is good

-- want a better inventory UI
-- 2d sprites:
--- towel, window cleaner, etc
- okay for whatever reason, the cursor disappears when clicking in the game, and this is causing onMouseOver to no longer run

- can put grace also on model tuning + environment creation

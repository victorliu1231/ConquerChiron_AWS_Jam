- todo list
-- could ask Will to texture the notepad, would make it look really cool
-- extra: add in dictation to the game
- make sure settings and player inventory are setactive and gamemanager isdebugging is false
- if I have the input field, then exit by clicking Q, then quickly press E to go back, the AI UI somehow breaks.
-- if have extra time -- sort out the most hostile of player responses and use those as the top three to guide AI's response
-- also give history of AI responses and player prompts if extra time
- have the AI bot be context-aware of game state (for the later half of the game too).
- implement what happens when you fail a task (should take advantage of current checkpoint)

- debug why asteroid task has player FirstPersonController as isCameraFree = true when it is supposed to have been set to false
- when finishing connectthewires, the player somehow has clipped through the floor

- horror mode
--- test out shaking position during air purge task
--- okay the transitions are pretty bad, the player should APPROACH these tasks, not be forced into them.
--- also the AI responses during horror mode are pretty bad, test these
- have player give its own responses and dictate them

- have AI greet you upon starting a run (Perhaps query: "Hi, who are you?" to the AI)
- have AI be context-aware and give you a summary upon continuing a run
- ai boss fight mode... HUGE next step
- died screen sfx
- reset game upon going to checkpoint, e.g. making sure asteroid task is restarted etc

- transition to AI being evil comes from talking to Chiron
- AI transitions faster to evil if you trashed talked it earlier?? (maybe have this integrated into gameplay somehow, need WitAI sentiment analysis
-- have it override tasksRemaining bool)
- make AI bring up daily maintenance tasks needs periodically
- Windows in Grace rooms should be transparent

- new sfx needed:
-- unwrench something
-- task complete sfx

- test checkpointing
-- checkpoint should have gamestate, player position, player rotation, player inventory, etc
- make death screen better looking
- have AI mock player when they die

- implement frenzy mode

- maybe in easy mode, the AI gives more on-the-nose directions
- on failing oxygen pressure gauge calibration, have player AI narrate a response

- add in game title
- add in Will's animation models
- move player to proper transform location so that it's hands look correct
- maybe in horror mode you have to physically open the doors, it's no longer automatic
- need generic item click sfx and use for replacing fuse
- need unwrench sfx and use for unwrenching fuse
- GameManager EquipItem(Item item) function throwing error when called as a UnityEvent
- prevent dragging entire inventory screen?
- preferably autosave settings in playerprefs
- fix picking up items not properly setting a fixed rotation bug
- coroutine bug with inventory being set inactive early???
- weird bug where player moves when picking up object
- make a "gamer mode" where the asteroid task starts out with 50 asteroids, and a "non-gamer mode" for judges,
-- where the task starts out with 30 asteroids
- make used battery be more rusty than new battery
- make sprites when in inventory be sized correctly
- dirty window changing into clean window animation
- add horror vibes, e.g. alarm blaring sounds, red alarm lights, etc
- decorate cockpit
- fix entrance door texture so that it's not one-side transparent other side not transparent

-- 3D player model
--- first person POV try to pick up lamp with grab motion
--- make the player taller
--- use Mixamo
---- use Unity Muse for grab motion
---- make hand motion for replacing battery
---- use Unity Muse for two hand hold object motion
---- need hand crank and hand motion models for pressure gauge task
---- need window spray animation for window cleaning task
---- need window wipe animation for window cleaning task
--- need some way to equip items in code so it looks good

- tutorial
-- wasd + arrow keys to move
-- space to jump
-- I for inventory
-- Shift for sprint
-- L Mouse Click to place down item

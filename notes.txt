-- FirstPersonController asset from Unity
-- Sci-fi props free asset from Unity Asset Store
-- Meta llama model
-- XEntity Inventory system (looks REALLY useful)
-- add in a hand for the character model later at some point to help with cursor control, otherwise for now using cursor is good

- art
-- want a better inventory UI
-- 2d sprites:
--- towel, window cleaner, etc
- okay for whatever reason, the cursor disappears when clicking in the game, and this is causing onMouseOver to no longer run

- can put grace also on model tuning + environment creation

- todo list
--- make spaceship environment art based off of current assets in spaceship asset pack (I think this is bugging me a lot bc rest of game depends on this)
--- make other minigames

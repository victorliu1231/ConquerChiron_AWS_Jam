- art
-- want a better inventory UI
-- 2d sprites:
--- towel, window cleaner, etc

- todo list
--- make spaceship environment art based off of current assets in spaceship asset pack (I think this is bugging me a lot bc rest of game depends on this)
--- make other minigames
--- get human model in game
--- do prelim research if it's easy to train meta llama model for customized output (lowkey could task Grace with this??? But I might be better since I actually took an ML class)
--- make a "gamer mode" where the asteroid task starts out with 50 asteroids, and a "non-gamer mode" for judges,
---- where the task starts out with 30 asteroids
--- put in Grace's main menu screen + font type into game
--- make sure if win the connect dots game, actually exit the task
-- make the connect the wire game harder, either through random generation or player-made levels

- tutorial

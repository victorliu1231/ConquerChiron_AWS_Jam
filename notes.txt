- PlayerInventory has to be active in order for it to work bc of Awake functions

- todo list
- prevent dragging entire inventory screen?
- preferably autosave settings in playerprefs
- add in cargo hold tasks
- fix picking up items not properly setting a fixed rotation bug
- in dialogue for AI, make sure it mentions to actually open the panel
- task to train the model falls on me :/
- weird bug where player moves when picking up object
- do prelim research if it's easy to train meta llama model for customized output (lowkey could task Grace with this??? But I might be better since I actually took an ML class)
- make a "gamer mode" where the asteroid task starts out with 50 asteroids, and a "non-gamer mode" for judges,
-- where the task starts out with 30 asteroids
- make used battery be more rusty than new battery
- make battery sprite when in inventory be sized correctly
- dirty window changing into clean window animation
- add horror vibes, e.g. alarm blaring sounds, red alarm lights, etc
- decorate cockpit
- fix entrance door texture so that it's not one-side transparent other side not transparent

-- 3D player model
--- first person POV try to pick up lamp with grab motion
--- make the player taller
--- use Mixamo
---- use Unity Muse for grab motion
---- make hand motion for replacing battery
---- use Unity Muse for two hand hold object motion
---- need hand crank and hand motion models for pressure gauge task
---- need window spray animation for window cleaning task
---- need window wipe animation for window cleaning task
--- need some way to equip items in code so it looks good

- tutorial
-- wasd + arrow keys to move
-- space to jump
-- I for inventory
-- Shift for spring
-- E to interact with items
-- L Mouse Click to place down item

- bottom priority:
-- have player not able to look or interact when settings is open

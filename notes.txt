-- FirstPersonController asset from Unity
-- Sci-fi props free asset from Unity Asset Store
-- Meta llama model
-- XEntity Inventory system (looks REALLY useful)
-- add in a hand for the character model later at some point to help with cursor control, otherwise for now using cursor is good
- Asteroids 3D model pack for asteroids

- art
-- want a better inventory UI
-- 2d sprites:
--- towel, window cleaner, etc

- can put grace also on model tuning + environment creation

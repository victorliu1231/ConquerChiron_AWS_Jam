- to do list
- make sure settings and player inventory are setactive and gamemanager isdebugging is false
- if I have the input field, then exit by clicking Q, then quickly press E to go back, the AI UI somehow breaks.
-- also give history of AI responses and player prompts if extra time
-- window cleaning animation, add in Will's updated model

--- extra time, make the player be an actual hand model (probably can do this by smart anim rigging)
- when finishing connectthewires, the player somehow has clipped through the floor

- lever pull model might be unnecessary
- equipping items should pop up model for hand on screen

- would be cool for player to respond to ai for after exiting terminal too.
- same for player realizing entering frenzy mode

- implement leaderboard
- implement end of story

- horror mode
--- also the AI responses during horror mode are pretty bad, test these

- hide aws credentials by using aws cognito
- maybe make Chiron a male voice idk

- died screen sfx

- unequip items upon dying
- make set equippable positions in Equippable for all equiped items

- make AI bring up daily maintenance tasks needs periodically
- Windows in Grace rooms should be transparent
-- extra: checkpointing into positions doesn't work

- game should be fully complete now though

- make death screen better looking
- have AI mock player when they die

- inventory bug
--- i had done the pressure gauge and then purged the air, so i had the crowbar equipped
after i picked up the spray bottle and the towel, i went to the window, but it wasn't activating the task (i think because i was still holding the crowbar)
and then pressing 'i' didn't do anything

- probably want to make sure going back to checkpoint preserves item UI whether an item is equipped or not
-- bug with preserving equippedItems, might not be the worst thing though to unequip all items upon death

- now fix the connect wires task, and make sure player is stationary and camera is frozen while doing it

- test frenzy mode

- on failing oxygen pressure gauge calibration, have player AI narrate a response
- make win sequence

- move player to proper transform location so that it's hands look correct
- maybe in horror mode you have to physically open the doors, it's no longer automatic
- need generic item click sfx and use for replacing fuse
- prevent dragging entire inventory screen?
- coroutine bug with inventory being set inactive early???
- dirty window changing into clean window animation
- add horror vibes, e.g. alarm blaring sounds, red alarm lights, etc
- decorate cockpit

- need some way to equip items to show up as a model so it looks good

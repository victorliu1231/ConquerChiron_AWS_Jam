- todo list
-- make other minigames - pressure gauge
-- fix picking up items not properly setting a fixed rotation bug
-- in dialogue for AI, make sure it mentions to actually open the panel
-- get human model in game
-- do prelim research if it's easy to train meta llama model for customized output (lowkey could task Grace with this??? But I might be better since I actually took an ML class)
-- make a "gamer mode" where the asteroid task starts out with 50 asteroids, and a "non-gamer mode" for judges,
--- where the task starts out with 30 asteroids
-- task to train the model falls on me :/
-- R to place down item (can only place down in specific locations)
-- first person POV try to pick up lamp with grab motion
--- use Unity Muse for grab motion
--- use Unity Muse for two hand hold object motion
- make used battery be more rusty than new battery
- make hand motion for replacing battery
- make battery sprite when in inventory be sized correctly
- use Mixamo
- make task for poisonous H2S
- have equipabbles (and modify tasks code so that it asks for having the equippable in hand)
-- inventory not working again :/

- tutorial
-- wasd + arrow keys to move
-- space to jump
-- I for inventory
-- Shift for spring
-- E to interact with items
-- L Mouse Click to place down (but maybe it should be more)

- bottom priority:
-- have player not able to move or interact when settings is open
-- settings volume doesn't set correctly
-- cannot interact with buttons in settings or pause menu in GameScene
